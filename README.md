Bridging visual modalities and natural language is a interesting yet challenging task. It attracts more and more research highlights and requires interdisciplinary efforts from Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

This repository contains recent papers on Image Captioning, Text-to-Image Generation and Text-Image Matching. Hopefully, it could be used as a warehouse of learning materials.
